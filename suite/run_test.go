Scenario 1: Successful subtest execution

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function properly executes a subtest when the subtest does not panic and completes successfully. The test also verifies if the necessary setup and teardown methods are called appropriately.

Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a TestingSuite and a subtest function that does not panic.
Act: Call the Run function with the TestingSuite and the subtest function as parameters.
Assert: Confirm that the Run function returns true, indicating successful execution. Also, ensure that the setup and teardown methods were called.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles successful subtest execution. It is important as it validates the primary functionality of the Run method, which is to execute subtests within a test suite.

Scenario 2: Subtest execution with panic

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function properly handles a scenario where the subtest panics. It should recover from the panic and continue execution.

Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a TestingSuite and a subtest function that panics.
Act: Call the Run function with the TestingSuite and the subtest function as parameters.
Assert: Confirm that the Run function returns false, indicating that the subtest did not complete successfully.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles panic scenarios. This is crucial as it ensures that a panic in one subtest does not impact the execution of other subtests.

Scenario 3: Subtest execution without SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function correctly executes a subtest when the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest methods are not present in the suite.

Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a TestingSuite without SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest methods and a subtest function that does not panic.
Act: Call the Run function with the TestingSuite and the subtest function as parameters.
Assert: Confirm that the Run function returns true, indicating successful execution.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function can handle a suite that does not have setup and teardown methods. This is important as these methods are optional and not all test suites may implement them.

Scenario 4: Subtest execution with SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function correctly executes a subtest when the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest methods are present in the suite.

Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a TestingSuite with SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest methods and a subtest function that does not panic.
Act: Call the Run function with the TestingSuite and the subtest function as parameters.
Assert: Confirm that the Run function returns true, indicating successful execution. Also, ensure that the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest methods were called.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles subtest execution when setup and teardown methods are present. This is important as it validates that the Run function correctly calls these methods when they are available in the suite.
