Scenario 1: Successful subtest execution

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function properly executes a subtest without any errors or panics. It also ensures that the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces are correctly called if they are implemented.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a TestingSuite mock with a subtest that doesn't panic or return errors. Implement SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces with function calls that can be tracked.
Act: Invoke the Run function with the TestingSuite mock and a subtest function.
Assert: Check if the subtest was executed successfully, and if the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest functions were called.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles the subtest execution and calls the appropriate interface functions. This is crucial for the correct setup and teardown of subtests, ensuring that tests don't interfere with each other.

Scenario 2: Subtest execution with panic

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function properly recovers from a panic in a subtest and ensures that the test doesn't stop execution due to the panic.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a TestingSuite mock with a subtest that panics.
Act: Invoke the Run function with the TestingSuite mock and a subtest function.
Assert: Check if the Run function recovered from the panic and completed execution.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles panics in subtests. This is important to ensure that a panic in one subtest doesn't stop the entire test suite from running.

Scenario 3: Subtest execution without SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces

Details:
Description: This test checks if the Run function properly executes a subtest when the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces are not implemented.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a TestingSuite mock without SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces and with a subtest that doesn't panic or return errors.
Act: Invoke the Run function with the TestingSuite mock and a subtest function.
Assert: Check if the subtest was executed successfully.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the Run function correctly handles the execution of a subtest even when the SetupSubTest and TearDownSubTest interfaces are not implemented. This is important for flexibility, as not all TestingSuites would need these interfaces.
